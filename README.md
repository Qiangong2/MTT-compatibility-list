# Moore Threads Compatibility List
This is an index of game performance of Moore Threads GPUs. Specifically the MTT S80

You can find the MUSA SDK here under the releases tab

You can find all of the games and their playable status on the issues tab: https://github.com/Qiangong2/MTT-compatibility-list/issues

There is no DX12 support as of yet with any Moore Threads GPU. So any DX12 listed games in the Issues tab will not be updated until it is added.

Games marked "playable" will not be updated with later driver version info

The MTT S80's specs are:

(This was taken from the PES Control Center software)

The MTT drivers are here: https://developer.mthreads.com/driver

As a general rule, DX9 and DX10 games will perform great on the MTT S80, DX11 support is only partially there, and DX12 support is non-existent.
